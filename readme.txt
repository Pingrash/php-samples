This repository is for samples of PHP code that I have learned through tutorials.
I plan on possibly using parts of these code in future projects.
Everything is set up like a proper website which I primarily use Bootstrap for. This is so I can continue to practice using Bootstrap while still learning about PHP and SQL.
